> Conceptual development plan for a custom operating system.

#

Sourceduty OS is an innovative Linux-based operating system tailored for users seeking enhanced functionality and unique features for a more intuitive and personalized experience. This development plan outlines the steps to implement its distinctive features, ensuring a robust and user-friendly OS.

### Unique Features Implementation

### 1. Right-Click Format

- **Objective**: Integrate a file converter option in the right-click context menu to allow users to easily convert files to different formats.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Develop a plugin or extension for the file manager to add a "Convert to..." option in the context menu.
  2. Implement a file conversion backend supporting multiple formats.
  3. Ensure seamless integration with the desktop environment for user accessibility.

### 2. Cursor Taskbar

- **Objective**: Implement a hidden taskbar menu that appears around the cursor when activated, providing quick access to frequently used apps and settings.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Design the UI for the cursor-attached taskbar with customizable slots for apps and settings.
  2. Develop the activation mechanism (e.g., specific mouse gesture or keyboard shortcut).
  3. Integrate with the OS's window management system for responsive interaction.

### 3. Trash Icon Capacity

- **Objective**: Display the trash bin's capacity and current usage visually through the icon, enhancing user awareness of storage consumption.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Modify the trash icon to dynamically change based on its fill level.
  2. Implement a background service to monitor trash size and update the icon accordingly.
  3. Ensure compatibility with different desktop environments.

### 4. OS Deviance

- **Objective**: Measure and report changes made by users to the default OS settings, aiding in troubleshooting and customization.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Develop a tracking system for default settings and user modifications.
  2. Create a reporting tool within the settings menu to display changes.
  3. Implement privacy controls to ensure user consent and data protection.

### 5. Regulated Files

- **Objective**: Enforce regulation of files within and outside the File Manager, ensuring organized and secure file management.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Develop a file management policy engine for setting and enforcing rules.
  2. Integrate the engine with the File Manager and desktop environment.
  3. Provide a user interface for customizing file management policies.

### 6. Sequenced File Folders

- **Objective**: Automatically create a new folder when a new folder is named, streamlining the folder creation process.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Modify the File Manager's folder creation workflow to include sequential folder creation.
  2. Implement a naming convention system for automatically named folders.
  3. Ensure user control and customization options for the feature.

### 7. Battery Level Cursor

- **Objective**: Indicate the battery level of an optical mouse within the mouse cursor, enhancing user convenience.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Develop a system to read the battery level from compatible wireless mice.
  2. Design cursor themes that dynamically reflect the battery level.
  3. Integrate this feature with the OS's input device management system.

### Development Methodology

- Agile methodology will be adopted to allow for iterative development and flexibility in accommodating changes.
- Bi-weekly sprints will be organized to review progress, address challenges, and plan subsequent tasks.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Unit testing will be conducted for individual components to ensure reliability and functionality.
- Integration testing will follow to ensure seamless interaction between the new features and the existing OS components.
- User acceptance testing (UAT) will be organized with a focus group to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### Timeline

- Preliminary research and planning: 2 weeks
- Development sprints: 3 months
- Testing phase: 1 month
- Beta release and feedback collection: 1 month
- Final adjustments and official release: 2 weeks

### Resource Allocation

- Development Team: 5 developers, 2 UI/UX designers
- QA Team: 3 testers
- Project Manager: 1
- Stakeholder meetings will be held monthly to ensure alignment with project goals and expectations.

### Risk Management

- Regular code reviews and adherence to coding standards to mitigate technical debt.
- Frequent backups and version control to prevent data loss.
- Contingency time allocation for unforeseen challenges.

### Conclusion

The "Sourceduty OS" project aims to redefine user experience with unique and intuitive features. By following this development plan, we anticipate delivering a Linux-based OS that not only meets but exceeds user expectations in terms of functionality and ease of use.
